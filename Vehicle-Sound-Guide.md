Hello!

Very often there are messed-up sounds across vehicle mods.

I started categorizing in-game engine sounds, so that it was easier for me to assign correct engine sounds to my mods and other peoples´. I hope this list can solve many wrong sound problems and save time for modders.

I use names from hash labels, so don´t get confused! You can copy-paste them directly under "audioNameHash".
This is a raw list, **BOLDED** names are my personal favorites (they somehow stood up more for me) and unbolded sounds are usually much more "generic".

**R4 petrol engines**
ASEA
BIFTA
BLISTA - Lower revs
**BLISTA2** - Same as BLISTA3
**BLISTA3** - Same as BLISTA2
**BRIOSO** - Higher revving 4cyl

**B6 petrol engines**
**COMET** - Yes, this is the Porsche boxer engine.

**R6 petrol engines**

JOURNEY

**V8 petrol engines**
There are quite a lot of V8s in this game. I try to categorize them, using common sense based on a lifelong interest in cars.

***Straight-pipe, raw*** - Mostly used on older muscle cars. I think it is one of the most realistic engine sounds to use in the game when putting it on an actual muscle car or car with straight pipes (catless).
DUKES
GAUNTLET - bit less loud/more muffled sound
HOTKNIFE
**MAMBA** - my favorite on the list
PHOENIX
PICADOR - bit less loud/more muffled sound
RUINER
SABRE
VIGERO

***Straight-pipe, raw (extreme Harley Davidson/tractor sound)*** - Basically the same, as above, but these are already tractor sounds, which You will meet on several modern era high-end high horsepower tuned luxury cars.
DOMINATOR - It may sound a little different, more "higher-revving".
DUKES2
**MARSHALL** - My personal favourite of the list, fits **godly** onto the Brabus 850 S Coupe.
MONSTER - a bit more muffled.
**FACTION3** - Quite similar to MARSHALL, great sound though!
SLAMVAN - more raw, than SLAMVAN3
SLAMVAN3

***Lower-revving "calm" V8*** - most ordinary stock V8 sound ever? These are very popular on common stock daily driver V8-s, not at all such raw, as the upper ones.
**BALLER3**
**BLADE** - although the variation is probably the same as on some others in the list (VOODOO, if not mistaken), this is the most essential in the list for me.
BULLET - more quiet/lower rev
CHINO
CHINO2
CONTENDER - more quiet/lower rev
DUNE
**LYNX** - more higher rev/louder
MANANA
**PATRIOT** - more quiet/lower rev
STALLION
TAMPA
**TORNADO**
**VOODOO**
**VOODOO2**
**YOUGA2** - more quiet/lower rev
