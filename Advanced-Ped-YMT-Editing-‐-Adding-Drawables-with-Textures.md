Hopefully simple to follow tutorial with screenshots and videos. No 3D software required. This isn't a tutorial about modeling, it's about adding drawables like clothes and hairstyles from one ped to another - assuming they are compatible. Experience with OpenIV and file manipulation in Windows strongly recommended.

And of course, backup your peds before experimenting with them.
