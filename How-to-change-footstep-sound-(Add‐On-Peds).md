What you do is have the editor open, export your add-on peds ymt file via OpenIV or whatever other program you have your add-on ped on.

Then press file and click on "Open (YMT)" then click on your exported ymt file. You'll then be in a page called "Components", press the LOWR or FEET option depending on what ped you have and click on "View component properties".
You'll see different hashes, flags and etc, you'll see something called "shoe_xxx". Reason I put those x's is because there's a couple of different shoe types for npc's.

Those being:

shoe_flip_flops - For sandals or flip flops
shoe_barefoot - For no shoes
shoe_heels - For high heels
shoe_trainers - For sneakers
shoe_heavy_boots - For combat boots
shoe_dress_shoes - For both dress shoes, like oxfords
shoe_rubber_boots - For normal boots

Just click on it and choose which type of footstep sounds you'll like to pick.
I've made a pic-by-pic tutorial, if you're confused: https://imgur.com/a/TtQMLWt

After you're done changing the sounds, just press file and save it as a YMT to replace your normal one and drag and drop it in OpenIV. To make sure you did it right, just open your edited YMT on the editor again and check if the footstep sounds are how you left it. Once everything went right, you should be good to go.
