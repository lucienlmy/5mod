you'll want the lastest CW, only available from dexyfex' discord, https://discord.gg/BxfKHkk 

**ambiently spawning vehicles are controlled by ymaps, via a ```cargen```**

Start CW and press T for the toolbar 
so you can create a new ymap with a new cargen inside
and press the ```<< icon```  to your right, in that side window:
then set the **View tab** to World View and on the **Selection tab** select cargens in the drop-down box
so you'll see the vanilla cargens as blue squares placed on your map as you don't want to place your vehicle over a vanilla vehicle ;)

In the dialogue you can type a specific vehicle model 
or even a POPGROUP VEH CATEGORY such as LARGE_CITY eg to have to game choose a model from what you have in set in popgroups in that category

You can also make the cargen spawn a vehicle in a specific color (just like in carvariations.meta) and even a specific livery 
where the livery to use is one minus the sign_ in the YTD 
so if you want vehicle_sign_8 to show up, set to livery to value '7'
I always set Flags value to 3683 as I found this to work in my game

You can move the vehicle around via the blue/red/green arrows but only when the move icon is selected on the Toolbar (the icon with arrows surrounding it)

for some reason a ymap always needs to have at least ONE prop inside I took JRod's protagonists garage ymap as a template and worked on that as he placed a small prop invisible under the world map

you can export an ymap to ymap.xml for Notepad editing via OpenIV via right-mouse button *'export to OpenFormats'*
after I create my own cargen I copy those entries via Notepad into JRod's ymap.xml and drag that file into my custom dlcpack to make the game load it

you can import the created ymap via OpenIV into your game
use a **custom_maps** dlcpack to make the game load your own created cargens
