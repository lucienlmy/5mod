**Are PC Single-Player Mods Allowed?**
**Rockstar Games answer:** Rockstar Games believes in reasonable fan creativity, and, in particular, wants creators to showcase their passion for our games. After discussions with Take-Two, Take-Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstarâ€™s PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties. This does not apply to (i) multiplayer or online services; (ii) tools, files, libraries, or functions that could be used to impact multiplayer or online services, or (iii) use or importation of other IP (including other Rockstar IP) in the project. This is not a license, and it does not constitute endorsement, approval, or authorization of any third-party project. Take-Two reserves the right to object to any third-party project, or to revise, revoke and/or withdraw this statement at any time in their own discretion. This statement does not constitute a waiver of any rights that Take-Two may have with respect to third-party projects.

**ADITIONAL INFORMATION**: 
If someone needs an older **GTA V Launcher.exe** or **Social Club Setup.exe** version or you want to know how many and which versions of the game were released since the start of the GTA V life, **[take a look here](http://patches.rockstargames.com/prod/gtav/versioning.xml)**.

This may be helpful for people who installed the latest update and wants to revert back. If for some reason when reverting back from a backup you can't play because the game and/or the Social Club versions aren't correct together, you can download an old one from there.

Also, if you still didn't update your game and you want to be able to play avoiding the game from updating when launched while waiting for a new **ScriptHookV** version, use **[GTAVLauncher ByPass](https://es.gta5-mods.com/tools/gtavlauncherbypass)** tool by **@Unknown-Modder**. I use it since the **GUNRUNNING** update and works perfect.

If you use **GTA V** from **Steam** you'll need to do some other things to prevent it from updating your game before using the tool. I have a retail copy so I can't help there.
